//! A 'sink' is a final destination for telemetry and log lines. That is, a
//! 'sink' is that which is at the end of a `source -> filter -> filter ->
//! ... -> sink` chain. The sink has no obligations with regard to the telemetry
//! and log lines it receives, other than to receive them. Individual sinks make
//! different choices.
